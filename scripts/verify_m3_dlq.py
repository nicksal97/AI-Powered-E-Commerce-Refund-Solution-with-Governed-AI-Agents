"""M3 dead-letter drill — a case that crashes the pipeline 3x lands in
`dead_letter`, is auto-escalated, and is logged. Never an infinite retry.

Method (real, not mocked): toggle the worker's documented fault-injection hook
(`RG_PIPELINE_FORCE_ERROR`), which makes `review_return` raise a real exception
after claiming the case — exercising the genuine retry -> dead_letter -> escalate
path. Restore the worker afterwards.
