"""Return review job.

`review_return` claims a pending return, runs the full LangGraph pipeline
(pipeline/graph.py), and lets GovernanceGate finalize it. Every step writes a
real `agent_runs` row + streams `agent_run_events` (Redis pub/sub → dashboard WS)
+ records a Langfuse generation. Retry is counted on `returns.review_attempts`;
3 crashes → `dead_letter` + auto-escalate. Never an infinite retry.
