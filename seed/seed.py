"""Seed real products: store a real photo per product in MinIO, insert the
product row. Idempotent (upsert by SKU). Also writes the baseline policy docs
(M4 embeds them into Qdrant).

Run: `make seed`  (docker compose run --rm backend python -m seed.seed)

Product photos: a real, on-topic image per SKU lives in `seed/images/<SKU>.jpg`
(committed — fetched once from Openverse by `seed/fetch_images.py`, CC-licensed).
If a SKU has no local file we fall back to downloading its `image_url`.
